Introduction

- With server-side web applications, a web browser must make a request to the server and await a response, in order to complete a task that a user has requested. 

BUT NOW WEB BROWSERS HAVE BECOME POWERFUL.

-  They are able to handle more complicated calculations and client-side frameworks are starting to become more popular
-  The clientÂ therefore is responsible for processing and running the code locally.
