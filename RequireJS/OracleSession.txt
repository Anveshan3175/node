Introduction

- With server-side web applications, a web browser must make a request to the server and await a response, in order to complete a task that a user has requested. 

BUT NOW WEB BROWSERS HAVE BECOME POWERFUL.

-  They are able to handle more complicated calculations and client-side frameworks are starting to become more popular
-  The clientÂ therefore is responsible for processing and running the code locally.

Applications become faster
 - The round trips have become less
 
 
 MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
  - ADF uses MVC model pattern 
  -  JET uses a different architecture pattern called MVVM
  - MVVM is common in client-side implementations, due to its two-way data binding between the View and ViewModel, 
    meaning that any data changes in the ViewModel are sent to the UI components, and any user inputs from the UI are updated in the ViewModel
